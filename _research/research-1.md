Our research is mainly centered on fundamental understanding of structure,
dynamics and chemical reactions at the catalytic and environmental interfaces
using the state-of-the-art simulation techniques. We employ molecular dynamics
and free energy simulations to study these properties. The accuracy of these
properties from computer simulations is highly dependent on the quality of the
underlying potential energy surface representation. For this, we are
interested in the development of potential energy surfaces using artificial
Neural Networks. We are also interested in predicting the properties of liquids
and materials, and the existence of new materials under extreme conditions.
